What is catheter ablation?  Catheter ablation is a procedure that is used to treat certain conditions that cause the  heart to beat too fast. It is sometimes called "radiofrequency catheter ablation,"  "cryothermal ablation," or "cold ablation." This procedure is done in the hospital.  How do normal heartbeats happen?  A normal heartbeat happens when an electrical signal starts in one spot near the top of  the heart. This electrical signal follows a path to spread across the heart. As it spreads, the  signal causes the heart muscle to squeeze. Each time the heart squeezes ("beats"), blood  is sent all over the body. Normally, the heart beats in a regular way 60 to 100 times a  minute.  What can cause the heart to beat too fast?  The heart can beat too fast when:  People with heart problems as well as those with healthy hearts can have heartbeats that  ®  The electrical signal starts in the wrong part of the heart ●  The electrical signal follows the wrong path as it spreads across the heart ● 04.07.2023 09.20 Patient education: Catheter ablation for the heart (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 2 af 7 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-for-the-heart-…ducation:%20Atrial%20fibrillation%20&topicRef=3431&source=see _ link  are too fast.  How does catheter ablation work?  Catheter ablation destroys the part of the heart that is creating or spreading abnormal  electrical signals. After the procedure, the heart can beat normally again.  How do I get ready for the procedure?  Your doctor will tell you what to do to get ready for the procedure. For example, you might  need to stop taking certain medicines.  What happens during the procedure?  When the procedure starts you will get medicines to make you sleepy. Then the doctor will  insert a thin tube called a "catheter" into a large blood vessel in your leg or another part of  your body (   figure 1 ). Next they will guide the catheter into your heart. Using wires that  are inside the catheter, the doctor will try to destroy the small parts of the heart causing  the fast heartbeat. At the end of the procedure, the doctor removes the catheter and  wires.  What happens after the procedure?  After the procedure, your doctor or nurse will tell you which medicines you should take.  They will also tell you which activities you should avoid.  What are some downsides of the procedure?  Downsides of the procedure can include:  Bleeding, bruising, or getting an infection in the area where the catheter was put in ●  Damage to the heart from the wires ● 04.07.2023 09.20 Patient education: Catheter ablation for the heart (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 3 af 7 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-for-the-heart-…ducation:%20Atrial%20fibrillation%20&topicRef=3431&source=see _ link  Is catheter ablation the only treatment for a fast heartbeat?  No. Doctors can use other treatments for a fast heartbeat. These can include medicines,  other procedures, or surgery.

They put a thin plastic tube, called a  "catheter," in a blood vessel that is just below the cut. Then, they move the tube  through your blood vessels to your heart. When the tube is in place, your doctor 04.07.2023 09.20 Patient education: Catheter ablation for the heart (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 6 af 7 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-for-the-heart-…ducation:%20Atrial%20fibrillation%20&topicRef=3431&source=see _ link  can do different tests. Most people have a test called "coronary angiography." For  this test, the doctor injects a dye that creates pictures to show if your heart  arteries are clogged.
