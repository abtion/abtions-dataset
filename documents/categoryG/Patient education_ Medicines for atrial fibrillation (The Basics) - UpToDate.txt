What is atrial fibrillation?  Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm problem (   figure 1 ). The condition  puts you at risk of stroke, heart attack, and other problems. Another term for atrial  fibrillation is "A-fib." If you have A-fib, you might:  Why do I need medicines to treat atrial fibrillation?  Having atrial fibrillation puts you at risk for a stroke and other problems, including heart  attack and heart failure. The medicines your doctor or nurse prescribes to treat atrial  fibrillation can help lower the risk of these problems. Some medicines can also help  reduce your symptoms.  Which medicines might I need?  There are 3 main types of medicines for treating atrial fibrillation (   table 1 ). They  include:  ®  Feel as though your heart is racing, pounding, skipping beats, or beating out of sync ●  Have mild chest "tightness," pain, or discomfort ●  Feel lightheaded, dizzy, or like you might pass out ●  Have trouble breathing, especially when you exercise ● 04.07.2023 09.17 Patient education: Medicines for atrial fibrillation (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 2 af 12 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medicines-for-atrial-fibrillation…earch _ result&selectedTitle=2~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=2  Many people with atrial fibrillation also take an anticoagulant medicine to help prevent a  stroke. A stroke is when a blood clot travels from the heart to the brain. Taking an  anticoagulant medicine can prevent about 6 out of 10 strokes. There is a small risk of  having a bleeding problem when taking one of these medicines.  Your doctor or nurse will decide which medicines are best for you depending on:  Heart rate control medicines   – These medicines include "beta blockers" like  metoprolol   (brand names: Lopressor, Toprol XL) and   carvedilol   (Brand name: Coreg),  and "calcium channel blockers" like   diltiazem   (brand name: Cardizem) or   verapamil  (brand names: Cala SR, Verelan, Verelan PM). They work by slowing down the speed  of your heartbeat.   Digoxin   (sample brand names: Digitek, Lanoxin) is another  medicine that might be used to slow down your heart rate.  ●  Heart rhythm control medicines   – These medicines include   amiodarone   (brand  names: Cordarone, Pacerone) and   sotalol   (brand name: Betapace). They work by  helping the heart switch back to and stay in a normal rhythm.  ●  Medicines to help prevent blood clots and lower the risk of a stroke   – These  medicines are called "anticoagulants" or "blood thinners," although they do not  actually thin the blood. They include   apixaban   (brand name: Eliquis),   dabigatran  (brand name: Pradaxa),   edoxaban   (brand names: Savaysa, Lixiana),   rivaroxaban  (brand name: Xarelto), and   warfarin   (brand name: Jantoven). Warfarin is also  sometimes called "Coumadin," which is an old brand name for it. If you take  warfarin, you will need regular blood tests to check how well it is working. There are  other differences among the medicines, too (   table 2 ).  ●  Most people with atrial fibrillation take heart "rate control" medicines. Other people  with atrial fibrillation take rhythm control medicines instead. The "rhythm control"  medicines can be a better choice for people who still have symptoms when taking  heart rate control medicines. Some people take both kinds of medicines.  Your age ●  Your symptoms and how often they occur ●  Your other health problems, if you have any ●  If you already had a stroke ●  How long you have had atrial fibrillation ● 04.07.2023 09.17 Patient education: Medicines for atrial fibrillation (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 3 af 12 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medicines-for-atrial-fibrillation…earch _ result&selectedTitle=2~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=2  Your doctor will probably need to adjust the doses of your medicines. Sometimes, people  need to try several different medicines to find one that works best for them.  What can I do to be safe?  To keep safe, it's important to take your medicines exactly as your doctor tells you, so you  get the correct amount of each medicine. Using pill boxes and reminders can help  (   picture 1   and   table 3 ).  Your doctor and pharmacist need to know all of the medicines you take. This includes any  over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbs. So it's a good idea to keep a list of the  names and doses and bring it with you each time you visit any doctor. You can find an  example of a list at this website:   www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/my-  medicine-record .  If your medicines cause troublesome side effects, or if you can't afford your medicines,  talk to your doctor or nurse. There are often ways to deal with these problems. The first  step is to let your doctor or nurse know.  For more detailed information about your medicines, ask your doctor or nurse for the  patient hand-out from Lexicomp available through UpToDate. It explains how to use each  medicine, describes its possible side effects, and lists other medicines or foods that can  affect how it works.

Use a daily or weekly pill box to organize your medicines.  Keep your medicine containers in a place you will see them every day.  Create reminders for yourself to take your medicines. You can use a calendar, a smartphone  app, a digital watch, or whatever works to help you remember.  Read the prescription label and printed patient information that comes with each medicine.  Do not skip pills, change doses, or take extra pills unless your doctor tells you to. The dose your  doctor prescribes is based on your age, weight, health problems, and other medicines you take.  It can be dangerous to take different amounts.  Learn the names of each of your medicines, how it works, and why you take it.  Learn what each of your medicines looks like (shape, size, color). When you get a refill, you  might get a new generic version that looks different from the last time. That is OK as long as  the new medicine has the same ingredient as the one it is replacing. If you are worried about a  refill looking different, talk to your pharmacist.  Tell your doctor or nurse about any side effects you have. They might have ways to reduce or  get rid of the side effects.  Tell your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist if you can't afford your medicines. There are often ways  to lower costs.  Make a list of all the medicines you take, plus any medicines you are allergic to or have had  problems with in the past. Keep 1 copy at home and 1 in your wallet.  Bring a bag containing   all   your medicines with you to your doctor's office, every time you go. If  you can't do this, bring the list of your medicines. Have your doctor or nurse go over your  medicines or list with you.  Talk to your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist   before   you take any cough, cold, allergy, pain, or  other extra medicines. The same goes for supplements and herbal medicines. Over-the-counter  and herbal medicines can affect the way prescription medicines work.
