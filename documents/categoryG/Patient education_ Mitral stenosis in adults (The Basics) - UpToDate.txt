What is mitral stenosis?  Mitral stenosis is a condition in which 1 of the valves in the heart, called the mitral valve,  doesn't open fully. When they work normally, the heart valves do 2 things:  The mitral valve keeps blood flowing from the left atrium to the left ventricle (   figure 1 ).  In mitral stenosis, the mitral valve does not open fully, so the valve opening is too narrow.  Then, blood can get backed up in the left atrium, in the blood vessels in the lungs, and in  the right side of the heart.  When the valve opening is very narrow, the blood flow from the left atrium to the left  ventricle might be less than normal. Blood backs up in the left atrium, the lungs, and the  right side of the heart, and not enough blood flows forward.  What are the symptoms of mitral stenosis?  Early on, most people have no symptoms. They might find out they have mitral stenosis  after their doctor or nurse hears a heart murmur on a routine exam. A heart murmur is an  extra sound in the heartbeat that doctors or nurses hear when they listen to the heart  with a stethoscope.  ®  Open all the way to let blood flow through them ●  Keep blood flowing in only 1 direction ● 04.07.2023 09.23 Patient education: Mitral stenosis in adults (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 2 af 9 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitral-stenosis-in-adults-the-ba…ucation:%20Atrial%20fibrillation%20&topicRef=3431&source=see _ link  When people have symptoms of mitral stenosis, doctors call the condition "heart failure."  Heart failure means that blood is not flowing normally through the heart. Heart failure  does not mean the heart has actually stopped working. Symptoms can include:  Mitral stenosis can also lead to problems such as:  Is there a test for mitral stenosis?  Yes. The test done most often to check for mitral stenosis is an echocardiogram (also  called an "echo"). This test uses sound waves to create a picture of the heart as it beats. It  shows the size of the heart chambers, how well the heart is pumping, and how well the  heart valves are working (   figure 2 ).  Sometimes, people have a test called a "stress test" along with their echo. A stress test  measures how well the heart works when it pumps very fast. When a stress test is done  with an echo, it's called a "stress echo."  All people with mitral stenosis will have a test called an electrocardiogram (also called an  "ECG"). This test measures the electrical activity in the heart (   figure 3 ).  Some people with mitral stenosis will also have a chest X-ray. A chest X-ray shows the size  Trouble breathing – This is the most common symptom. At first, people usually have  trouble breathing only during physical activity. But later on, people can have trouble  breathing at rest, too.  ●  Feeling tired ●  A severe cough, or coughing up blood or mucus ●  Swelling in the legs ●  A heart rhythm problem called "atrial fibrillation" ●  Blood clots forming in the heart – If blood clots form in the heart, pieces can break  off and travel through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. They can then get  stuck in small blood vessels and block them off. This can cause organ damage such  as a stroke, which is when part of the brain is damaged.  ● 04.07.2023 09.23 Patient education: Mitral stenosis in adults (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 3 af 9 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitral-stenosis-in-adults-the-ba…ucation:%20Atrial%20fibrillation%20&topicRef=3431&source=see _ link  and shape of the heart. It can also show changes in the lungs from mitral stenosis or  other diseases.  How is mitral stenosis treated?  Treatment depends on your symptoms and how severe your mitral stenosis is. If you have  mild mitral stenosis or no symptoms, you might not need any treatment. But your doctor  will follow you to see if your mitral stenosis gets worse or you start to have symptoms.  If your mitral stenosis causes symptoms or is severe, treatment can include:  Can I play sports?  It depends on your mitral stenosis and symptoms. You and your doctor should discuss the  level of physical activity that is right for you.  Do I need to take antibiotics before I go to the dentist?  No. In the past, doctors recommended that people with mitral stenosis take antibiotics  before going to the dentist or having certain medical or dental procedures. But now, only  people with certain heart conditions need antibiotics in these situations. For example,  people with a prosthetic (replacement) valve need to take antibiotics before some  procedures. The same is true for people who have had a valve infection in the past. But  A procedure to open your mitral valve – For this procedure, a doctor inflates a  balloon in the narrowed mitral valve to try to open it.  ●  Surgery – Doctors can do different types of surgery to treat mitral stenosis. One type  involves opening up the narrowed mitral valve. Another type involves replacing the  narrowed valve with a "prosthetic" valve. This new valve can be made from metal or  from tissue from an animal (such as pig or cow) or another person.  ●  Medicines – A procedure or surgery is the main way to treat mitral stenosis that  causes symptoms. But certain medicines can help with symptoms or prevent  problems caused by the mitral stenosis.  ● 04.07.2023 09.23 Patient education: Mitral stenosis in adults (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 4 af 9 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitral-stenosis-in-adults-the-ba…ucation:%20Atrial%20fibrillation%20&topicRef=3431&source=see _ link  most people with mitral stenosis do not need antibiotics in these situations.  What if I want to get pregnant?  If you want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor before you start trying. Pregnancy can  worsen or trigger symptoms of mitral stenosis. Because of this, your doctor might  recommend treating your mitral stenosis before you get pregnant.

The top 2 chambers are called the  right atrium and left atrium. The bottom 2 chambers are called the right and left  ventricles. Each of these chambers has a valve that keeps blood flowing in 1  direction. The valves in this picture appear in gray. When the heart is working  normally, blood comes in from the body through the right atrium and into the  right ventricle. From there it goes to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Then  the blood comes back through the left atrium, into the left ventricle, and back  out to the body through a blood vessel called the aorta. The aorta appears in red.  If a valve doesn't work properly, it will either let blood flow backward in the  wrong direction or not let enough blood flow forward.

To do an  echo, a doctor or nurse puts some gel on a person's chest. They press a thick  wand (called a "transducer") against the chest and move it around. An echo  uses sound waves to create images of the heart that appear on a computer  screen. A test called an electrocardiogram (ECG) is done during an echo. For  an ECG, patches (called "electrodes") are stuck to a person's chest. Wires run  from the patches to a machine that records the electrical activity of the heart.
