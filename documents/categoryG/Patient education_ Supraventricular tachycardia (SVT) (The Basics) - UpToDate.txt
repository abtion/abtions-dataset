What is supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)?  Supraventricular tachycardia ("SVT") is a heartbeat that is faster than normal. It usually  starts and stops suddenly, without warning. SVT is also called "paroxysmal  supraventricular tachycardia" ("PSVT"). (Paroxysmal means a sudden attack.)  SVT happens because of a problem with the heart's electrical system. The left and right  ventricles are the main pumping chambers of the heart. SVT starts above the ventricles  (   figure 1 ).  With SVT, the fast heartbeat can last from seconds to hours. It can happen when you are  at rest. But in some people, exercise triggers it.  The 3 main types of SVT are called:  What are the symptoms of SVT?  You might not have symptoms. But you might feel like your heart is beating too fast,  beating hard, or seems to skip a beat. These kinds of heartbeat changes are called  ®  Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia ("AVNRT") ●  Atrioventricular reentry tachycardia ("AVRT") ●  Atrial tachycardia ● 04.07.2023 09.24 Patient education: Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 2 af 9 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-tachycardia-svt…ucation:%20Atrial%20fibrillation%20&topicRef=3431&source=see _ link  "palpitations."  You might also feel:  If you also have coronary heart disease, you might also:  Should I see a doctor or nurse?  If you have trouble breathing or have chest pain that lasts for more than a few minutes,  call for an ambulance   (in the US and Canada,   call 9-1-1 ).  If you do not have these problems, but you often feel your heart beating fast or  irregularly, talk to your doctor or nurse.  Is there a test for SVT?  Yes. Your doctor or nurse will do a test called an electrocardiogram ("ECG"). This test  measures the electrical activity in your heart (   figure 2 ).  Other possible tests include various types of longer-term heart monitoring. This can be  done using 1 of several devices:  Lightheaded ●  Dizzy ●  Very tired ●  Have trouble breathing ●  Feel a tightness in your chest ●  Holter monitor – This is a small, portable machine that you wear. It records all pf  your heart's electrical activity over 1 or 2 days (   figure 3 ).  ●  Event or loop monitor – These are similar to Holter monitors but smaller, because  they don't record all of the time. Instead, you start the monitor when you feel  symptoms (   figure 4 ). Your doctor will likely have you wear this type of monitor  every day for about a month.  ●  Patch monitor – This is a newer type of monitor. It goes directly on the skin, without ● 04.07.2023 09.24 Patient education: Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 3 af 9 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-tachycardia-svt…ucation:%20Atrial%20fibrillation%20&topicRef=3431&source=see _ link  How is SVT treated?  The treatment depends on the cause of the tachycardia.  For some types of heart rhythms, your doctor might suggest ways to slow it down. They  might have you cough, or bear down as if you're having a bowel movement. Doing these  things can affect the nerve that helps control your heartbeat.  Other treatments can include:  If the tachycardia comes back often and causes symptoms, treatment can include:  More on this topic  Patient education: Tachycardia (The Basics)  Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)  Patient education: Vagal maneuvers and their responses (The Basics)  Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (The Basics)  Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (Beyond the Basics)  All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our   peer review process   is complete.

Medicines to control the speed or rhythm of your heartbeat ●  Cardioversion – This involves applying an electrical current to the heart to fix its  rhythm.  ●  Medicines to prevent the abnormal rhythm ●  Ablation – This is a treatment to destroy the small part of the heart that is sending  the abnormal electrical signals. It can use heat (called "radiofrequency ablation") or  cold (called "cryoablation").  ● 04.07.2023 09.24 Patient education: Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 4 af 9 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraventricular-tachycardia-svt…ucation:%20Atrial%20fibrillation%20&topicRef=3431&source=see _ link  This generalized information is a limited summary of diagnosis, treatment, and/or  medication information.

The heart has 4 chambers: right  atrium, left atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle. Blood flows  from the right atrium to the right ventricle through the tricuspid  valve. Blood flows from the left atrium to the left ventricle through  the mitral valve.

There are patches, called "electrodes," stuck onto the chest, arms, and  legs. Wires run from the electrodes to the ECG machine. An ECG measures the  electrical activity in the heart.

The device measures  the electrical activity in the heart. It helps doctors pinpoint heart  rhythm problems. You will have "electrodes" stuck to your chest that  are connected to wires leading to the monitor. These electrodes tell  the monitor how often your heart beats and if it has a normal  rhythm. While you have a Holter monitor on, you should do your  normal activities but keep the electrodes, wires, and device dry.  Some people have an abnormal heart rhythm only during certain  activities or certain times of the day.

The patient must activate the  recorder and hold it to the chest when they feel symptoms. It is  useful for patients that have intermittent symptoms that may not be  captured with other forms of testing.
