ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and  atrial fibrillation  INTRODUCTION  Initial studies suggested that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin  receptor blockers (ARBs), and (possibly) aldosterone antagonists might either prevent new  onset and recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) or reduce the rate of major adverse  cardiovascular outcomes in these patients. However, the available data do not support the  use of these drugs solely for these purposes.  In this topic, ACE inhibitors and ARBs collectively will be referred to as "angiotensin  inhibition."  POSSIBLE MECHANISMS  Mechanisms proposed to explain the benefit of angiotensin blockade found in the early  studies included the direct effects of angiotensin blockade on the structural and electrical  properties of the atria, as well as the indirect influence of improved control of heart failure  and hypertension (in patients with these conditions), both of which are known risk factors  for atrial fibrillation (AF) [ 1 ].

The following observations supported the proposed mechanisms:  PREVENTION OF NEW ONSET AF  Post-hoc analyses of randomized trials and observations from nonrandomized studies  have suggested that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin  receptor blockers (ARB) reduce the incidence of new atrial fibrillation (AF) in a variety of  settings including the treatment of left ventricular dysfunction or hypertension, and after  coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).  The following findings were noted in a 2010 meta-analysis of data from 26 randomized  trials [ 8 ]:  Reduction in atrial stretch — Atrial stretch, due to increased left atrial (LA) pressure, is  associated with changes in the refractory period and conduction properties of atrial  myocardium. These abnormalities provide both potential triggers and the substrate  for the initiation and perpetuation of AF. The hemodynamic effects of angiotensin  converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) result in  improved ventricular function and also reductions in LA pressure and wall stress [ 2 ].  ●  Prevention of atrial fibrosis — Fibrosis in the atrial myocardium may be an important  component of the substrate necessary for AF. Atrial fibrosis is stimulated by elevated  levels of angiotensin-II [ 3 ] and reduced by treatment with ACE inhibitors [ 4,5 ].  ●  Prevention of electrical remodeling and direct antiarrhythmic effects — Direct effects  of angiotensin blockade on ion channels and electrophysiologic properties have been  suggested [ 6 ], but data from both animal and human studies have been conflicting  and inconclusive. Canine work has suggested direct inhibition of triggering of atrial  arrhythmias by ACE inhibitors and ARBs [ 7 ].  ●  ACE inhibitors and ARBs significantly reduced the risk of the development of AF (Odds  Ratio [OR] 0.65, 95% CI 0.55-0.76); the benefit was equivalent with the two classes of  drugs.  ●  The benefit of ACE inhibitors and ARBs appeared large in patients with systolic heart ● 04.07.2023 09.07 ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 3 af 7 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitors-angiotensin-recep…ch _ result&selectedTitle=22~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=21  However, the strength of the conclusions from the meta-analysis is weakened due the  inclusion of post hoc analyses of randomized trials performed for reasons other than  prevention of AF (eg, heart failure, post-myocardial infarction [MI], or hypertension),  heterogeneity, and the likely presence of publication or ascertainment bias.  Left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure   —   In the TRACE trial of patients with left  ventricular dysfunction and sinus rhythm after an acute myocardial infarction,   trandolapril  therapy was associated with a significantly reduced incidence of subsequent AF at two- to  four-year follow-up (2.8 versus 5.3 percent with placebo) [ 9 ].  Similar findings were noted in retrospective analyses from the randomized trials SOLVD  and Val-HeFT, which enrolled patients with chronic left ventricular dysfunction, almost all of  whom had ischemic heart disease [ 10,11 ]. In the SOLVD trial,   enalapril   significantly reduced  the incidence of subsequent AF at a mean follow-up of 2.9 years (5.4 versus 24 percent with  placebo, hazard ratio 0.22). (See   "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and receptor  blockers in acute myocardial infarction: Clinical trials"   and   "Management and prognosis of  asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction", section on 'ACE inhibitors' .)  A smaller reduction in the incidence of new AF with the ARB   candesartan   was noted in the  CHARM trials [ 12 ]. Among 7601 patients enrolled in the three trials, 6379 patients did not  have AF at baseline. At a median follow-up of 38 months, candesartan produced a  reduction in the incidence of new AF (5.6 versus 6.7 percent, adjusted P value 0.039).  Hypertension   —   Some [ 13-17 ], but not all [ 18-20 ], studies comparing ACE inhibitors or  ARBs to other classes of drugs in patients with hypertension have shown a lowering of the  risk of development AF. A 2010 meta-analysis of trials with substantial heterogeneity found  no significant reduction in the risk for AF [ 21 ].  The role of angiotensin blockade in the treatment of hypertension is discussed separately.  (See   "Choice of drug therapy in primary (essential) hypertension" .)  Patients with other risk factors for atrial fibrillation   —   The issue of whether these  therapies might prevent the development of AF in patients with risk factors other than left  failure (OR 0.50), but the result was not statistically significant (95% CI 0.19-1.16).  The effect of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was greater in preventing recurrent AF (OR 0.45,  95% CI 0.31-0.65) compared to new-onset AF (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.92)  ● 04.07.2023 09.07 ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 4 af 7 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitors-angiotensin-recep…ch _ result&selectedTitle=22~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=21  ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, or hypertension, such as diabetes or coronary artery  disease, has not been well studied. (See   "Epidemiology, risk factors, and prevention of  atrial fibrillation" .)  Coronary artery bypass graft   —   The possible role of these therapies for the prevention of  AF in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is discussed elsewhere. (See   "Atrial fibrillation  and flutter after cardiac surgery", section on 'Ineffective or possibly effective therapies' .)  PREVENTION OF RECURRENT AF  Multiple small studies have demonstrated reduction in recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) with  use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers  (ARBs), but these findings have not been confirmed in larger, better powered studies.  In small trials that enrolled fewer than 200 patients, ACE inhibitors or ARBs in combination  with   amiodarone   reduced the rate of recurrent AF compared with amiodarone alone [ 22-  26 ]. A small study of   ramipril   versus placebo in hypertensive patients demonstrated  reduced AF recurrence with ramipril [ 26 ] and a small randomized study comparing  telmisartan   to   carvedilol   in hypertensive patients with prior AF demonstrated less  recurrence of AF in patients treated with telmisartan, despite similar blood pressure  reduction between the two agents [ 27 ]. However, these results from smaller studies were  not confirmed in the GISSI-AF trial, which randomly assigned 1442 patients with a history  of symptomatic AF and in sinus rhythm to receive either   valsartan   or placebo [ 28 ]. All  patients had underlying cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or left atrial enlargement.  GISSI-AF found that   valsartan   did NOT prevent recurrent AF. At one-year follow-up, there  was no significant difference between valsartan or placebo in the proportion of patients  who had more than one episode of AF (51 versus 52 percent, adjusted hazard ratio 0.97,  95% CI 0.83-1.14) or in the median time from randomization to the first recurrence of AF  (295 versus 291 days). Although 57 percent of patients were taking an ACE inhibitor and 70  percent were taking antiarrhythmic drugs at baseline that were continued throughout the  trial and might have confounded the results, the outcomes in subgroup analysis were  similar in the patients who were or were not being treated with such agents.  Another possible contributor to the lack of benefit in GISSI-AF was a low prevalence of  heart failure/left ventricular dysfunction (8 percent), since the meta-analysis cited above 04.07.2023 09.07 ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 5 af 7 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitors-angiotensin-recep…ch _ result&selectedTitle=22~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=21  found that the benefit was greatest in patients with these conditions [ 29 ].  Prevention of recurrent AF with   irbesartan   was also analyzed in the ACTIVE I study, which  randomized 9016 patients with a history of AF, stroke risk factors and a systolic blood  pressure of at least 110 mm Hg to either irbesartan 300 mg once daily or placebo. Patients  who received irbesartan in ACTIVE I were not significantly more likely to be in sinus rhythm  at subsequent follow-up, regardless of whether they were initially in AF at baseline or in  sinus rhythm at baseline (RR 0.97, p = 0.61). Similarly, the ANTIPAF study, a randomized  study of placebo versus   olmesartan   in patients with documented paroxysmal AF,  demonstrated no benefit in regard to recurrent AF episodes in patients randomized to  olmesartan [ 30 ].  Aldosterone inhibition and atrial fibrillation   —   There are data from animal and human  studies to suggest that   spironolactone , an aldosterone antagonist, may reduce the risk of  recurrent AF [ 31,32 ]. Supportive studies of specific drugs are summarized as follows:  Eplerenone   – A newer aldosterone antagonist, eplerenone, was shown in the  randomized EMPHASIS-HF study to reduce new onset AF in patients with systolic  heart failure and mild heart failure symptoms [ 33 ]. Eplerenone was also shown in a  small study to decrease AF recurrence after catheter ablation for long-standing  persistent AF [ 34 ].  ●  Spironolactone   – In the TOPCAT randomized trial of spironolactone in patients with  heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, spironolactone did not reduce the  incidence of AF [ 35 ] (see   "Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved  ejection fraction"   and   "Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved  ejection fraction", section on 'Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists' ). A 2016 meta-  analysis did suggest reduced AF in patients treated with aldosterone antagonists  based on three randomized controlled trials and two observations studies, although  this effect was evident for   eplerenone   but not spironolactone [ 36 ].  ●  Finerenone   – In a secondary analysis of the randomized FIDELIO-DKD trial of patients  with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, those assigned the mineralocorticoid  receptor antagonist finerenone resulted in a lower incidence of new-onset atrial  fibrillation or flutter compared with placebo (hazard ratio 0.71; 95% CI 0.53-0.94) [ 37 ].  ●  Meta analysis of aldosterone-antagonists   – A 2019 meta-analysis of 24 studies ● 04.07.2023 09.07 ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 6 af 7 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitors-angiotensin-recep…ch _ result&selectedTitle=22~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=21  Although there appears to be potential benefit to the use of aldosterone inhibitors in heart  failure patients, we do not recommend aldosterone inhibitors specifically for prevention of  new or recurrent AF. The details of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in heart failure  are presented separately. (See   "Primary pharmacologic therapy for heart failure with  reduced ejection fraction", section on 'Primary components of therapy' .)  Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation   —   The data are mixed as to whether ACE  inhibitors/ARBs reduce AF after radiofrequency catheter ablation procedures: A significant  benefit was seen in some [ 39 ], but not other [ 40,41 ] studies. (See   "Atrial fibrillation:  Catheter ablation" .)  PREVENTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS  As discussed in the sections on prevention above, the benefit of either angiotensin  converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) therapy for the  prevention of new or recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) is uncertain. The issue of whether ARB  therapy can reduce the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with AF was  addressed in the ACTIVE I trial, which enrolled individuals with either permanent AF or at  least two episodes of intermittent AF (in the previous six months) from the ACTIVE A and  ACTIVE W trials [ 42 ]. (See   'Prevention of recurrent AF'   above and   "Atrial fibrillation in adults:  Use of oral anticoagulants"   and   "Atrial fibrillation in adults: Use of oral anticoagulants",  section on 'Introduction' .)  Mean reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 2.9 and 1.9 mmHg greater  in the   irbesartan   group. At a mean follow-up of 4.1 years, there was no significant  difference in the rates of the first combined coprimary outcome of stroke, myocardial  infarction, or death from vascular causes for the irbesartan compared with placebo groups  (5.4 percent per 100 person-years in both groups), and there was no significant difference  in the rates of the second combined coprimary outcome, which included the components  (representing both randomized and observational studies, with a total of 7914  patients) demonstrated a significant reduction in AF occurrence in aldosterone-  antagonist-treated patients compared with control patients (odds ratio 0.55; 95% CI  0.44-0.70), with significant AF reduction demonstrated in randomized and  observational studies, and regardless of the particular aldosterone antagonist used  [ 38 ]. 04.07.2023 09.07 ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 7 af 7 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ace-inhibitors-angiotensin-recep…ch _ result&selectedTitle=22~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=21  of the first coprimary outcome plus the rate of hospitalization for heart failure (7.3 and 7.7  percent per 100 person-years in the two groups, respectively).  A Swedish registry study of patients followed after acute myocardial infarction showed that  use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs did reduce all-cause mortality, but did not reduce the  incidence of new-onset AF [ 43 ].
