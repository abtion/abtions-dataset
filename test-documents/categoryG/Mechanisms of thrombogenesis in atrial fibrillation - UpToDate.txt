Mechanisms of thrombogenesis in atrial fibrillation  INTRODUCTION  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity, largely due to  thromboembolism, particularly stroke. This complication can occur with either paroxysmal  (intermittent) or chronic (permanent) AF. A number of randomized trials have  demonstrated the efficacy of   warfarin   in reducing this risk both during the course of  chronic AF and in the period prior to and after the restoration of sinus rhythm. (See   "Atrial  fibrillation in adults: Use of oral anticoagulants"   and   "Prevention of embolization prior to  and after restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation" .)  The factors that promote thromboembolism in AF will be reviewed here.  FACTORS PROMOTING THROMBOEMBOLISM  Almost 150 years ago, Virchow proposed that three conditions should be present for  development of thrombosis [ 1 ]:  Each of these abnormalities may contribute to thromboembolism in AF [ 2,3 ].  ®  author :   Gregory YH Lip, MD, FRCPE, FESC, FACC  section   editor :   Bradley P Knight, MD, FACC  deputy   editor :   Nisha Parikh, MD, MPH  All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our   peer review process   is complete.

Abnormalities in blood flow ●  Abnormalities in the blood vessel wall ●  Interaction with blood constituents ● 04.07.2023 08.58 Mechanisms of thrombogenesis in atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 2 af 15 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-i… _ result&selectedTitle=11~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=10  As an example, dilated atria, poorly contracting dilated left ventricles, valvular heart  disease (particularly mitral stenosis), and congestive heart failure are clinical features  commonly associated with stroke and thromboembolism in patients with AF [ 2 ]. These  abnormalities in blood flow and vessels (the first two components of Virchow's triad) can  be related to the presence of structural heart disease or extrinsic interventions such as  cardioversion. As will be described below, AF also may confer a hypercoagulable or  prothrombotic state [ 3 ].  Pooled data from a meta-analysis have demonstrated that independent clinical risk factors  for stroke in nonvalvular AF include a history of hypertension and diabetes [ 4 ]. Patients  with heart failure are also at high risk, particularly those with left ventricular systolic  dysfunction or aneurysm formation [ 5-7 ]. (See   "Atrial fibrillation in adults: Selection of  candidates for anticoagulation" .)  These clinical criteria are complemented by echocardiographic findings, which have  demonstrated that a dilated left atrium, impaired left atrial function, and impaired left  ventricular systolic function are independent risk factors for stroke in patients with AF  (   table 1   and   table 2 )   [ 7 ]. (See   "Role of echocardiography in atrial fibrillation" .)  Left atrial abnormalities   —   A dilated left atrium and reduced left atrial and left atrial  appendage (LAA) blood flow on echocardiography are independent risk factors for  thromboembolism. Patients with these abnormalities are more likely to have stasis of  blood as demonstrated by the presence of spontaneous echo contrast or "smoke" on  transesophageal echocardiography; this increase in echogenicity is thought to represent  aggregation of red cells at low shear stress (   image 1   and   movie 1   and   movie 2 )   [ 8 ].  Spontaneous echo contrast has been related to hemodynamic and hemostatic  abnormalities and an increased risk of stroke and thromboembolism [ 8-13 ]. The presence  of both left atrial spontaneous echo contrast and chamber enlargement among patients  with nonrheumatic AF is strongly associated with an increased risk for cerebral ischemic  events (odds ratio 33.7 in one report) [ 11 ]. Left atrial spontaneous echo contrast does not  appear to be affected by anticoagulant therapy [ 14 ]. (See   "Role of echocardiography in  atrial fibrillation" .)  The fibrosis and inflammation seen in the left atrium of patients with AF are particularly  intense in the LAA and may predispose to adjacent thrombosis. In addition, the fibrillating  LAA is the only area within the left atrium that is comprised of pectinate muscle and can 04.07.2023 08.58 Mechanisms of thrombogenesis in atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 3 af 15 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-i… _ result&selectedTitle=11~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=10  create an appropriate milieu for blood stasis and thrombus formation.  Atrial stunning after cardioversion   —   Cardioversion of AF leads to an increased risk of  thromboembolism, particularly if patients are not anticoagulated before, during, and after  cardioversion. In addition to dislodgement of pre-existing thrombi, embolization may  result from de novo thrombus formation induced by impaired left atrial systolic function.  (See   "Prevention of embolization prior to and after restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial  fibrillation" .)  The transient atrial contractile dysfunction is also known as atrial "stunning," and can occur  whether sinus rhythm is restored spontaneously, by external or internal DC (electric)  cardioversion, or by drugs. The duration of the left atrial dysfunction appears to be related  in part to the duration of AF. In one report, full recovery of atrial mechanical function was  attained within 24 hours in patients with AF for   ≤ 2 weeks, within one week in patients with  AF for two to six weeks, and within one month with more prolonged AF [ 15 ]. The time  course of recovery of left atrial function could explain why the great majority of embolic  events in patients who remain in sinus rhythm occur within the first 10 days after  cardioversion [ 16,17 ]. (See   "Hemodynamic consequences of atrial fibrillation and  cardioversion to sinus rhythm", section on 'Atrial stunning' .)  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation   —   The risk of thromboembolic events in patients with  paroxysmal AF and relationship to AF burden (percentage of time in AF) is discussed  separately. (See   "Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation", section on 'Risk of embolization' .)  Paroxysmal AF is associated with abnormalities in atrial function, as evidenced by the  appearance of spontaneous echo contrast on transesophageal echocardiography [ 18 ], and  in hemostasis which presumably contribute to the increase in thrombotic risk. One report  supported the importance of AF duration as levels of beta-thromboglobulin and platelet  factor 4 (markers of platelet activation) were significantly increased during episodes more  than 12 hours in duration; there was also a trend toward an elevation in fibrinogen levels in  these patients [ 19 ]. In another series, patients with paroxysmal AF had intermediate values  of fibrinogen and fibrin D-dimer between normals and elevations seen in patients with  chronic AF [ 20 ]. In contrast, patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, who  retain active atrial contraction and have a low risk of stroke, had levels of hemostatic  markers that were similar to controls in sinus rhythm.  Left ventricular dysfunction   —   Heart failure by itself confers a risk of stroke and 04.07.2023 08.58 Mechanisms of thrombogenesis in atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 4 af 15 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-i… _ result&selectedTitle=11~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=10  thromboembolism; the risk is additive to that of AF [ 5,7,21 ]. A report from the SAVE trial,  for example, found a progressive increase in stroke risk during a 42-month follow-up in  patients with left ventricular dysfunction; furthermore, every 5 percentage point decrease  in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was associated with an 18 percent increase in the  risk of stroke [ 21 ]. In addition, there was a significant reduction in longitudinal stroke risk  associated with the use of   warfarin   (relative risk 0.19) or   aspirin   (relative risk 0.44). (See  "Antithrombotic therapy in patients with heart failure" .)  Similar findings were noted in a prospective study of 1066 patients entered into three  clinical trials evaluating the role of anticoagulation in nonvalvular AF (BAATAF, SPINAF, and  SPAF) [ 22 ]. The incidence of a stroke was 9.3 percent per year in patients with moderate to  severe left ventricular dysfunction, even in the absence of congestive heart failure,  compared to 4.4 percent per year in those with normal or mildly abnormal left ventricular  function (   figure 1 ).  The presence of a poorly contracting, dilated left ventricle is likely to promote stasis of  blood and lead to an increased risk of intracardiac thrombus formation and subsequent  embolism. A left ventricular aneurysm has both diastolic and systolic bulging or  dyssynergy which result in severe stasis of blood [ 5 ]. The incidence of thrombi within left  ventricular aneurysms ranges from 14 to 68 percent at postmortem, an observation that is  consistent with a 50 to 95 percent incidence at the time of aneurysmectomy [ 23 ]. The  reported incidence of systemic embolism in patients with a left ventricular aneurysm  ranges widely, from 0 to 52 percent [ 23-26 ].  Patients with heart failure, particularly those with a left ventricular aneurysm, also  demonstrate abnormalities of blood rheology, coagulation, and endothelial function,  suggesting the presence of a prothrombotic or hypercoagulable state. As an example, both  plasma fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor concentrations may be elevated in heart  failure, and platelet abnormalities are evident [ 27,28 ]. Since AF also confers a  hypercoagulable state, this may be additive to the hemodynamic and hemostatic  abnormalities conferred by heart failure [ 29 ].  Hypertension   —   Hypertension is a risk factor for stroke (usually thrombotic) and it  increases the risk of stroke associated with AF twofold [ 2,4,6 ]. How this occurs is unclear.  Hypertension may be associated with a hypercoagulable state due in part to abnormalities  in blood rheology and endothelial function [ 30 ]. 04.07.2023 08.58 Mechanisms of thrombogenesis in atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 5 af 15 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-i… _ result&selectedTitle=11~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=10  Valvular disease   —   Valvular heart disease, especially mitral stenosis, increases the risk of  stroke in AF 17-fold [ 31 ]. There is some evidence that the presence of mitral regurgitation is  protective against the development of intracardiac thrombi in chronic AF, presumably due  to enhanced turbulence and decreased stasis within the left atrium [ 5 ]. As an example, one  transesophageal echocardiography study of 169 patients with rheumatic heart disease, 63  percent of whom were in AF, found a preoperative incidence of left atrial spontaneous  contrast echo of 1, 30, and 54 percent and of thrombus of 1, 13 and 17 percent for those  with mitral regurgitation, combined mitral regurgitation and stenosis, and isolated mitral  stenosis, respectively [ 32 ]. Further support for this observation comes from a report of 32  patients with mitral regurgitation undergoing mitral valve repair; atrial indexes of  hypercoagulability were significantly lower than peripheral venous levels, consistent with  the clinical observations of reduced echo contrast and left atrial thrombosis [ 33 ].  These findings correlate with a reduced incidence of embolism in mitral regurgitation. The  Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) study, for example, reported that the annual  rate of clinical thromboembolism in patients with an enlarged left atrium and abnormal  left ventricular wall motion was lower in those with than in those without mitral  regurgitation (7.2 versus 15.4 percent) [ 34 ]. Chronic mitral regurgitation often leads to left  atrial dilatation and dysfunction and associated complications. However, even in the  presence of left atrial enlargement, severe mitral regurgitation is associated with a lower  incidence of embolism (9 versus 25 percent at 7.4 years in those in whom regurgitation  was absent or mild) [ 35 ].  Hypercoagulable state   —   A number of studies that measured indices of coagulability  suggest that AF confers a hypercoagulable state, increasing the risk of thromboembolism  and stroke [ 3,12,29,36 ]. One report of 109 patients with AF fibrillation evaluated the  relationship between hemostatic and hemodynamic parameters obtained with  transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and the presence of left atrial thrombus [ 12 ].  Compared to patients without evidence of thrombus, those with thrombus had  spontaneous echo contrast, reduced LAA velocity, increased plasma concentrations of  markers of platelet activation (beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4), increased  plasma markers of thrombogenesis (thrombin-antithrombin complexes, D-dimers), and  evidence of endothelial damage/dysfunction (elevated plasma and endocardial levels of  von Willebrand factor, which is released from damaged endothelium) [ 37 ]. (See   "Coronary  endothelial dysfunction: Clinical aspects" .) A multiple logistic model identified LAA velocity,  beta-thromboglobulin, and von Willebrand factor, but not spontaneous echo contrast, as 04.07.2023 08.58 Mechanisms of thrombogenesis in atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 6 af 15 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-i… _ result&selectedTitle=11~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=10  independent associates of left atrial thromboembolism [ 12 ].  Activation of the coagulation system has been identified in other reports of both  paroxysmal [ 19,20 ] and chronic AF [ 38-44 ]. This effect is independent of the presence or  absence of underlying structural heart disease. As noted above, reversion to sinus rhythm  results in normalization of hemostatic markers within two to four weeks [ 45,46 ].  Anticoagulation in patients with AF also alters the hypercoagulable state as illustrated by  the following observations:  Evidence of endothelial damage/dysfunction in AF is provided by the following  Fibrin D-dimer levels are increased in patients with AF. In one study, fibrin D-dimer  levels were highest in patients who were not receiving any antithrombotic therapy,  intermediate in those on   aspirin , and lowest in those treated with   warfarin   [ 41 ].  Similar findings were noted in another report in which patients with AF treated with  warfarin had lower levels of prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 and thrombin-antithrombin  complex than those treated with aspirin or no antithrombotic therapy [ 42 ].  ●  High fibrin D-dimer levels have been associated with an increased rate of embolic  events in patients with AF on oral anticoagulant therapy [ 47 ]. In one study, elevated  D-dimer levers ( ≥ 0.5 mcg/mL) were associated with more thromboembolic events  compared to those with low D-dimer levels (hazard ratio 15.8, 95% CI 3.33-75.5) [ 48 ]  ●  In a substudy from the AFASAK trial, 100 patients with chronic AF were randomized to  treatment with fixed minidose   warfarin   1.25 mg daily alone or in combination with  aspirin   300 mg/day, conventional warfarin therapy with dose adjusted to maintain an  International Normalized Ratio (INR) between 2.0 and 3.0 or aspirin 300 mg daily.  Patients treated with warfarin at any dose demonstrated a significant rise in the INR  with a corresponding reduction in prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 [ 49 ].  ●  The degree of anticoagulation with   warfarin   appears to be important. In one report,  ultra low-dose warfarin (1 mg/day) did not significantly alter plasma fibrin D-dimer or  beta-thromboglobulin levels [ 50 ]. A second study found that treatment with   aspirin  (300 mg daily) plus low-dose warfarin (1 or 2 mg daily) or low-dose warfarin alone (2  mg daily) did not significantly reduce any of the hemostatic markers; in contrast,  there was a significant reduction of fibrinogen and fibrin D-dimer with dose-adjusted  warfarin [ 51 ].  ● 04.07.2023 08.58 Mechanisms of thrombogenesis in atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 7 af 15 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-i… _ result&selectedTitle=11~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=10  observations:  Mechanisms   —   Although these observations suggest that AF is associated with a  hypercoagulable state and endothelial dysfunction, the precise mechanisms by which this  might occur are uncertain [ 3,12,56 ]. Abnormalities in cardiac blood flow (sluggish, slow  flow within the atria) may be partly responsible, adding to an endothelial disturbance in  the pulmonary vasculature [ 41,43 ]. The latter effect may stimulate lung macrophages to  produce hepatocyte stimulating factor (now known to be interleukin IL-6), increasing the  hepatic synthesis of fibrinogen, perhaps in a similar manner to smoking [ 57 ].  Other data suggest that inflammation may contribute to the hypercoagulable state in AF  [ 58 ]. As an example, high plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)  among patients with AF are independently related to indices of the prothrombotic state in  AF (eg, CRP to fibrinogen, IL-6 to tissue factor) [ 59 ]. CRP has also been related to the  presence of dense spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) in the left atrium or LAA on  transesophageal echocardiography [ 60 ]. SEC is a well-recognized independent predictor  for stroke and thromboembolism in AF. Indices of the prothrombotic state and  inflammatory markers (IL-6, but not CRP) may predict stroke and vascular events in AF  [ 54,61 ]. In a larger series of 880 AF patients, CRP was positively correlated to stroke risk  and related to stroke risk factors and prognosis (mortality, vascular events) [ 62 ].  Other mechanisms stimulating the prothrombotic state in AF that have been explored  include matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of matrix  metalloproteinases [TIMPs]) as well as growth factors. In one report, plasma levels of MMP-  1 were lower and plasma levels of TIMP-1 were higher in 48 consecutive patients with  permanent nonvalvular AF compared with controls [ 63 ]. However, these values were not  Endocardial damage and disorganization of the LAA endocardium has been described  in the setting of mitral valve disease, especially where AF is present [ 52 ].  ●  Abnormal plasma indices of endothelial damage/dysfunction, such as vWf, which  have been related to thrombogenesis [ 41 ], stroke risk [ 53 ], and adverse prognosis  [ 54 ]. (See   'Left ventricular dysfunction'   above.)  ●  Increased levels of circulating endothelial cells (CECs), an index of endothelial damage  in the setting of AF and target organ damage (heart failure, stroke, myocardial  infarction) [ 55 ].  ● 04.07.2023 08.58 Mechanisms of thrombogenesis in atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 8 af 15 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-i… _ result&selectedTitle=11~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=10  independently associated with the presence of AF on multivariate analysis. Instead, clinical  factors (that is, age, ischemic heart disease, or hypertension) and echocardiographic  variables (end-diastolic left ventricular diameter or left ventricular mass index) were found  to be independently associated with MMP system.  Abnormal growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, also a marker  of angiogenesis) have been related to tissue factor (TF) upregulation — and therefore  coagulation — at least in cancer pathophysiology. Among AF patients, TF levels have been  shown to be significantly correlated with plasma VEGF levels [ 64 ]. In separate studies,  plasma levels of TF and VEGF have also been shown to be increased in atherosclerosis, a  condition whose pathophysiology involves a tendency to thrombosis and angiogenesis  [ 65,66 ]. Similar observations have been noted for angiopoietin, another index of  angiogenesis [ 67 ].  Other possible mechanisms that have been proposed for the hemostatic abnormalities  include neuroendocrine activation [ 68 ], slow flow itself [ 69 ], increased expression of  markers of platelet activation including P-selectin and CD63 [ 70,71 ], and elevated serum  levels of lipoprotein(a) which is structurally similar to plasminogen and may have  antifibrinolytic action [ 72 ].  In a series that included 121 patients with AF, 78 with a history of AF but in sinus rhythm at  the time of the study, and 65 control subjects, markers of platelet activation were increased  in patients with AF and in those with a history of AF [ 71 ]. However, multivariable analysis  suggested that the degree of platelet activation was probably due to the underlying  cardiovascular diseases associated with AF rather than the AF itself. Indeed, another  marker of platelet activation, soluble CD40 ligand levels, was not related to the risk of  stroke nor to prognosis [ 62 ].  Prognostic value of elevated biomarkers   —   Measures of the prothrombotic state in  patients with AF, using biomarkers such as von Willebrand factor (vWF) or D-dimer (both of  which are discussed in the section above), have been evaluated for their prognostic value.  (See   "Clinical use of coagulation tests", section on 'Fibrin D-dimer' .)  With regard to vWF, the following observations have been made:  Among 1321 patients with AF, there was a significant stepwise increase in plasma vWf  levels as the risk of stroke increased [ 53 ].  ● 04.07.2023 08.58 Mechanisms of thrombogenesis in atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 9 af 15 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-i… _ result&selectedTitle=11~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=10  Two studies have found that D-dimer levels added to the ability of traditional risk factors to  predict adverse outcomes [ 47,48 ], while one did not [ 74 ].  Other biomarkers have been tested in highly selected clinical trial cohorts to predict the  risk of stroke, thromboembolism, or bleeding. These have included troponin, natriuretic  peptides, and growth differential factor 15 (GDF15) [ 75-77 ]. These have led to proposals of  biomarker-based stroke and bleeding risk scores, ABC-stroke, and ABC-bleeding,  respectively [ 78 ]. In the real world clinical setting, the ABC-stroke and ABC-bleeding scores  did not offer any advantage over clinical factor-based scores, such as CHA   DS   -VASc and  HAS-BLED [ 79,80 ]. Also, the small incremental value of improved prediction of high risk (at  least statistically) should be balanced against the simplicity and practicality for everyday  clinical use [ 78 ].  In another study, addition of multiple biomarkers enhanced the predictive value of  CHA   DS   -VASc and HAS-BLED, although the overall improvement was modest, the added  predictive advantage over original scores was marginal, and decision curve analyses found  lower net benefit compared with the original clinical scores [ 81 ].  Many of these biomarkers are predictive of thromboembolism, bleeding, death, heart  failure, and hospitalizations, as well as noncardiovascular conditions, such as glaucoma  progression. This may lead to confusion amongst clinicians over which end point to focus  on.  Use of indices of a prothrombotic or hypercoagulable state to test anticoagulation  therapies   —   Indices such as fibrin D-dimer are indicative of a prothrombotic state in AF.  They have been used as biomarker surrogates of thrombogenesis in AF when testing  anticoagulation regimes in Phase 2 clinical trials and to help with dose selection for large  Phase 3 clinical trials [ 82-85 ].  Two studies have suggested that the addition of plasma vWf levels to traditional risk  predictors may improve the ability to predict stroke and vascular events [ 54,73 ].  ●  In a study of 229 patients with permanent AF who were stabilized on   warfarin   therapy  for at least six months, high plasma vWF levels (>221 international units/dl) were an  independent predictor for adverse events, including death, stroke, and bleeding  during two years of follow-up [ 74 ].  ●  2   2  2   2 04.07.2023 08.58 Mechanisms of thrombogenesis in atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 10 af 15 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-thrombogenesis-i… _ result&selectedTitle=11~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=10  SUMMARY  The mechanisms leading to an increased risk of stroke, thrombus, and embolism in atrial  fibrillation (AF) are multiple, complex, and closely interact with each other. Many of these  factors can be explained by Virchow's triad for thrombogenesis. Consideration must be  given to the patient's age, the presence of structural heart disease, and clinical risk factors  such as previous hypertension, diabetes, various biomarkers, or heart failure (particularly  depressed left ventricular systolic function). In addition, AF appears to be associated with a  reversible hypercoagulable state, which complements the clinical and echocardiographic  features in explaining the mechanisms of thrombosis in this common disorder.
