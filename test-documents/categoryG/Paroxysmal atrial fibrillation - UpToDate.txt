Its prevalence in the  population increases with age, and it is estimated to affect over 4 percent of the population  above the age of 60 [ 1-3 ]. (See   "Epidemiology, risk factors, and prevention of atrial  fibrillation", section on 'Epidemiology' .)  This topic will discuss the clinical presentation, etiology, natural history, and management  for paroxysmal AF (PAF; also known as intermittent AF) highlighting differences and  similarities compared with more sustained forms of AF.  Perioperative AF is discussed separately. (See   "Atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing  noncardiac surgery"   and   "Atrial fibrillation and flutter after cardiac surgery" .)  DEFINITION AND PREVALENCE  PAF is defined as AF that terminates spontaneously or with intervention within seven days  of onset [ 4 ]. "Persistent," "longstanding persistent," and "permanent" are terms used for  types of AF with episode durations longer than one week. (See   "Atrial fibrillation: Overview  and management of new-onset atrial fibrillation", section on 'Classification and  terminology' .)  ®  authors :   David Spragg, MD, FHRS ,   Kapil Kumar, MD  section   editor :   Bradley P Knight, MD, FACC  deputy   editor :   Nisha Parikh, MD, MPH  All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our   peer review process   is complete.  Literature review current through:   Jun 2023.  This topic last updated:   Feb 14, 2022. 04.07.2023 08.53 Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 2 af 16 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/pr…earch _ result&selectedTitle=3~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=2  PAF has been reported as comprising 25 to 62 percent of AF cases [ 5 ]. The prevalence of  PAF may be underestimated, as many episodes (including some lasting more than 48  hours) are asymptomatic [ 6,7 ]. Also, the duration of recurrent AF episodes vary over time in  each individual, and progression to persistent or permanent AF is common. (See  'Recurrence of AF'   below and   'Progression to persistent AF'   below.)  Risk factors for developing PAF are similar to those associated with sustained AF and  include age, hypertension, structural heart disease including valve disease, and obstructive  sleep apnea. (See   "Epidemiology, risk factors, and prevention of atrial fibrillation" .)  PATHOGENESIS  Factors that precipitate PAF, particularly in patients without apparent structural heart  disease, are incompletely understood, but are thought to be linked to premature atrial  complexes (PACs; also referred to a premature atrial beats, premature supraventricular  complexes, or premature supraventricular beats) and alterations in autonomic nervous  system activity. (See   "Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation", section on 'Mechanisms of atrial  fibrillation: triggers and substrates'   and   "Epidemiology, risk factors, and prevention of  atrial fibrillation", section on 'Potentially reversible triggers' .)  Substrate alterations that may contribute to sustained AF are discussed separately. (See  "Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation", section on 'Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation: triggers and  substrates' .)  Premature atrial complexes   —   Studies have shown that the majority of episodes of PAF  are triggered by PACs [ 8-10 ], and greater frequency of PACs is associated with greater risk  of AF [ 11 ]. PAF episodes are less commonly preceded by atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, or  paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias [ 10,12 ]. Most PACs triggering PAF originate near  the ostia of the pulmonary veins (eg, in 89 and 94 percent of cases in two series [ 8,9 ]). Less  commonly, foci occur in the right/left atria, the vein of Marshall, and the superior vena cava  [ 9,13,14 ]. The importance of the pulmonary veins in the genesis of PAF is further  demonstrated by the beneficial effect of pulmonary vein isolation. (See   "Atrial fibrillation:  Catheter ablation" .)  PACs appear to be most important as triggers of PAF in patients who have structurally  normal or near-normal hearts. However, it is unclear if modification of the PAC burden can 04.07.2023 08.53 Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 3 af 16 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/p…earch _ result&selectedTitle=3~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=2  reduce AF risk. The relative importance of PAC and other triggers versus an abnormal  substrate is less clear in patients with significant structural heart disease. (See  "Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation", section on 'Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation: triggers and  substrates' .)  Autonomic nervous system   —   The autonomic nervous system may be involved, as both  parasympathetic (vagal) and sympathetic (adrenergic) tone [ 15 ] promote the development  and maintenance of AF [ 16 ]. (See   "Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation", section on 'Role of the  autonomic nervous system' .)  The frequency of autonomic stimuli as a trigger for PAF has not been well studied. In a  report from the European Heart Survey on AF, 1517 patients with PAF were categorized  according to trigger pattern: adrenergic, vagal, or both (6, 15, and 12 percent of the total  group, respectively) [ 17 ]. The prevalence of underlying heart disease (heart failure,  coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, or hypertension) was similar in the three  groups. In a report of patients referred for radiofrequency ablation due to symptomatic  drug-refractory PAF, the prevalence of vagal, adrenergic, or other AF was found 27, 7, and  66 percent of the time, respectively [ 18 ].  Parasympathetic tone   – Vagally-mediated AF commonly occurs at night or in the  early morning when vagal tone is normally predominant, and it is often seen in  athletic young men without apparent heart disease who have slow heart rates during  rest or sleep [ 16,19 ]. The induction of AF by vagal stimulation may result from  shortening of the atrial refractory period in only some areas of the atrial myocardium,  thus producing heterogeneity of atrial refractoriness [ 20 ]. Acetylcholine and increased  vagal tone shorten the atrial myocardial refractory period but vagal innervation of the  atria is heterogeneous. Vagal stimulation and associated hypotension may rarely  contribute to the development of syncope in association with episodes of AF [ 21 ]. (See  'Evaluation'   below.)  ●  Sympathetic tone   – Increased adrenergic tone may be associated with AF in patients  with underlying heart disease, associated with hyperthyroidism, and during exercise  or other activity [ 16 ]. Increased sympathetic tone shortens the atrial myocardial  refractory period and increases atrial myocardial conduction velocity. However, AF  during exercise testing is a rare event; in a retrospective review of 3000 exercise tests,  there were only four episodes of AF [ 22 ]. Sympathetic stimulation has also been  suggested as the cause for AF associated with surgery, particularly cardiac surgery.  ● 04.07.2023 08.53 Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 4 af 16 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/p…earch _ result&selectedTitle=3~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=2  There is no evidence suggesting that selection of therapy based upon the type of  autonomic dysfunction improves outcomes, with the exception of perioperative therapy  (such as beta blockers) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. (See   "Atrial fibrillation and  flutter after cardiac surgery" .)  CLINICAL PRESENTATION  General symptoms and signs   —   As for more sustained AF, PAF may or may not be  accompanied by symptoms, and the spectrum of symptoms is broad. The most common  complaints include palpitations, often accompanied by dyspnea (ranging from dyspnea  with exertion to dyspnea at rest), a sensation of lightheadedness, fatigue, weakness, or  generalized malaise. The severity and extent of symptoms and signs are affected by the  patient’s underlying cardiac condition, age, and rapidity and regularity of the ventricular  response. In patients with preexisting heart failure or at risk for heart failure, the loss of  atrial contraction and rapid ventricular rate associated with PAF may precipitate heart  failure (which may manifest as dyspnea, peripheral edema, and weight gain). (See   "The  management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure", section on 'mechanisms of  cardiac dysfunction' .)  In some patients, a rapid ventricular rate may precipitate angina and/or ischemic  electrocardiogram (ECG) changes which may be accompanied by troponin elevation; the  presentation may be consistent with an acute coronary syndrome or demand ischemia.  (See   "Acute coronary syndrome: Terminology and classification"   and   "Elevated cardiac  troponin concentration in the absence of an acute coronary syndrome" .)  Syncope is rare   —   PAF rarely causes syncope [ 23 ]. In some case, syncope and PAF are both  triggered by another disorder (eg, pulmonary embolism or vagal stimulus) [ 23,24 ]. The  termination of PAF is occasionally associated with lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope  due to a prolonged sinus pause, which may be caused by sinus node dysfunction  (   waveform 1 ). Sinus node dysfunction is commonly associated with AF, including PAF  [ 25 ]. Some patients have progressive atrial structural remodeling that may cause both  sinus node dysfunction and AF, while others may develop sinus node dysfunction  secondary to electrical remodeling caused by AF. (See   "Sinus node dysfunction: Clinical  (See   "Cardiovascular effects of hyperthyroidism"   and   "Atrial fibrillation and flutter  after cardiac surgery" .) 04.07.2023 08.53 Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 5 af 16 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/pr…earch _ result&selectedTitle=3~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=2  manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation", section on 'Symptoms'   and   "Sinus node  dysfunction: Epidemiology, etiology, and natural history", section on 'Etiology' .)  Rapid ventricular response in AF alone is rarely the cause of syncope except for patients  with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and a rapidly conducting accessory pathway. (See  "Syncope in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and etiologies", section on 'Cardiac  arrhythmias'   and   "Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Anatomy, epidemiology, clinical  manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations' .)  EVALUATION  The evaluation of patients with AF includes history, physical examination, ECG,  echocardiography, and laboratory tests, as described separately. (See   "Atrial fibrillation:  Overview and management of new-onset atrial fibrillation", section on 'Evaluation' .)  The ECG in AF displays rapid, low-amplitude, continuously varying fibrillatory (f) waves and  no discrete p waves. The ventricular rhythm is generally irregularly irregular (lacking a  repetitive pattern); however, AF can have a regular rhythm in the setting of complete heart  block. The ECG in patients with AF is described in detail separately (   algorithm 1 ). (See  "The electrocardiogram in atrial fibrillation" .)  NATURAL HISTORY  Recurrence of AF   —   The recurrence rate for PAF is high and has varied among studies. The  incidence of recurrence in various reports has ranged from 70 percent at one year (without  antiarrhythmic therapy) [ 26 ] to 60 to 90 percent at four to six years [ 27-30 ]. These reported  rates likely underestimate the actual rate of recurrence, since most episodes (including  some that last more than 48 hours) are asymptomatic [ 6,7 ]; such prolonged asymptomatic  episodes occurred in 17 percent of patients in a report using continuous monitoring [ 6 ].  That study also showed that 40 percent of patients had episodes of AF-like symptoms in  the absence of AF [ 6 ].  Risk factors for recurrent AF in patients with PAF are similar to those for recurrence after  cardioversion to sinus rhythm in patients with persistent AF. In the Stroke Prevention in  Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) trial, patients with any AF recurrence were more likely to have heart  failure (17 versus 8 percent) or a prior myocardial infarction (15 versus 5 percent) than 04.07.2023 08.53 Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 6 af 16 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/p…earch _ result&selectedTitle=3~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=2  patients without recurrence [ 31 ]. Echocardiographic factors associated with AF recurrence  included moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction (12 versus 3 percent in those  without recurrence) and larger left atrial diameter. Compared with a normal left atrial  diameter of less than 4.0 cm, the relative risk of recurrent AF was 1.6 with a left atrial  diameter between 4.1 and 5.0 cm and 4.5 above 5.0 cm.  Progression to persistent AF   —   By definition, PAF spontaneously reverts to sinus rhythm  within seven days of onset. The percent of patients with PAF who progress to persistent or  permanent AF increases with time. In different reports, the rate of progression to  persistent or permanent AF was 8, 12, 18, and 25 percent at one, two, four, and five years,  respectively [ 30-32 ]. In a 2016 registry report, approximately 36 percent of patients with  PAF had progressed to persistent AF within 10 years [ 33 ]. A study of patients with AF and  cardiac devices found that in a minority of patients with AF, persistent AF reverted to PAF  without any therapeutic intervention, underscoring our limited understanding of the  natural history of AF [ 34 ].  A number of studies have attempted to identify predictors of progression to persistent AF  [ 30,31 ]. In the report from SPAF cited above, the following differences were noted between  the patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF [ 31 ]: patients with PAF were younger, had  lower rates of hypertension and heart failure, had smaller left atrial diameters (4.3 versus  4.8 cm), and were less likely to have moderate to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction  (6 versus 18 percent). For every 1 cm increase in left ventricular systolic dimension, there  was a 1.8-fold greater risk of developing persistent AF. The risk of progression to persistent  AF with older age was quantified in two reports showing a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.41 to 1.82  for each 10-year increase in age [ 30,32 ].  The risk of transition from PAF to persistent AF also depends upon the underlying etiology  for the arrhythmia. Progression has been reported in approximately 66 percent of patients  with rheumatic mitral stenosis, 40 percent with hypertension, and 27 percent with ischemic  heart disease [ 35,36 ].  Risk of embolization   —   Studies suggest that the risk of thromboembolic events is higher  in patients with permanent or persistent AF, with higher AF burden (ie, daily duration or  percentage of time in AF), and in the days immediately after an episode of AF. A potential  limitation of prior studies is that they have been conducted in patients with implantable  cardiac monitors and/or devices, potentially limiting generalizability to other patient  groups. Patients with PAF and long periods of apparent sinus rhythm still may be at 04.07.2023 08.53 Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 7 af 16 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/pr…earch _ result&selectedTitle=3~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=2  significant risk for thromboembolism; PAF episodes and stroke are not always temporally  associated [ 37 ]. Recurrent episodes of PAF are common and may be asymptomatic [ 6,7,38 ].  Also, the surface ECG may not reflect left atrial appendage mechanical function [ 39 ].  The relationship between subclinical AF and cryptogenic stroke is discussed separately.  (See   "Cryptogenic stroke and embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS)", section on  'Occult atrial fibrillation' .)  PAF versus permanent or persistent AF   – A 2015 meta-analysis of 12 studies of  100,000 persons stratified clinical outcomes by AF type (paroxysmal and persistent or  permanent) [ 40 ]. The incidences of thromboembolism and all-cause mortality were  higher with non-paroxysmal AF than with PAF (adjusted HRs 1.38 [95% CI 1.19-1.61]  and 1.22 [95% CI 1.09-1.36], respectively). In a community-based (Japan) study (not  included in the above meta-analysis) of 1588 patients with PAF and 1716 with  sustained AF, PAF was an independent predictor of lower stroke/systemic embolism  risk (HR of approximately 0.50 in multiple models) compared with sustained AF [ 41 ].  ●  AF burden   – Evidence suggests that AF burden is associated with risk of  thromboembolic events, independent of CHADS   -VASC or ATRIA risk scores. However,  the available data do not provide a clear threshold of AF burden or duration for  elevated thromboembolic risk. The data suggest that AF episodes lasting longer than  17 to 24 hours impart significant risk, but the risk associated with shorter AF episodes  is uncertain.  ●  2  Daily duration of AF   – Studies have come to different conclusions as to a possible  threshold of daily AF duration that confers a long-term risk of embolization. A  pooled analysis of data on individuals with AF from five prospective studies (n =  10,016) evaluated the risk of ischemic stroke over a median follow-up of two years  with the following cut-off points of AF daily duration: 5 minutes, and 1, 6, 12, and  23 hours [ 42 ]. The stroke risks were over twofold for AF duration   ≥ 1 hour  compared with shorter durations (HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.22-3.64).  •  The prospective ASSERT study included 2580 subjects [ 43 ]. The initial report  indicated that asymptomatic (subclinical) episodes of AF lasting >6 minutes, as  compared with no episodes or episodes lasting   ≤ 6 minutes, were associated with  an increased risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (adjusted HR 2.50; 95%  CI 1.28-4.89). However, a follow-up study reporting on 2455 patients (mean follow- 04.07.2023 08.53 Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 8 af 16 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/p…earch _ result&selectedTitle=3~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=2  up of 2.5 years) found that only patients with episodes of subclinical AF lasting  longer than 24 hours, compared with patients with no subclinical episodes, were  at increased risk of subsequent stroke or systemic embolism (adjusted HR 3.24,  95% CI 1.51-6.95) [ 44 ].  Percentage of time in AF •  A retrospective study in 1900 adults with PAF who were not on anticoagulation  found that the burden of AF was associated with risk of thromboembolism  independent of ATRIA or CHA   DS   -VASc risk scores [ 45 ]. The median burden of  AF was 4.4 percent (interquartile range 1.1 to 17.2 percent). The unadjusted  incidence of thromboembolism while not taking anticoagulation was 1.51 per  100 person-years. The highest tertile of AF burden ( ≥ 11.4 percent) was  associated with a higher risk of thromboembolism (3.16 [95% CI 1.51-6.62])  compared with the lower tertiles.  -  2   2  In the RATE registry, 5379 patients with pacemakers or implantable  cardioverter-defibrillators were followed for a median duration of 22.9  months. Over 37,000 ECGs were adjudicated for the presence of atrial  tachycardia (AT) and/or AF [ 46 ]. Runs of   ≥ 3 consecutive premature atrial  complexes (PACs) were defined as AT/AF and short episodes were defined as  runs <15 to 20 seconds. Patients with clinical events (emergency department  visits/hospitalizations for heart failure, atrial or ventricular arrhythmia, stroke  or transient ischemic attack [TIA], and syncope) were significantly more likely  than those without to have long AT/AF episodes. In addition, patients with  clinical events were no more likely than those without to have short AT/AF. The  risk of stroke plus TIA was lower, but not statistically significantly so, in  patients with only short compared with only long duration AT/AF.  -  Temporal association between AF presentation and stroke onset   – Two case-  cross-over studies have examined the association between time in AF since onset and  stroke risk. One study linked a commercial database of continuous rhythm recording  to Veterans Administration clinical records. Stroke risk was highest during the five  days immediately after an episode of AF and waned over the 30 days following the  episode [ 47 ]. Another study linked a large health insurance database with  implantable cardiac device data in 890 patients with stroke [ 48 ]. This study had similar  findings to the above Veterans study in that five hours or more of AF was associated  ● 04.07.2023 08.53 Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 9 af 16 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/p…earch _ result&selectedTitle=3~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=2  MANAGEMENT  The management for patients with PAF is similar to that for the general population of  patients with AF. Important considerations are the duration of AF and the presence or  absence of symptoms during episodes. (See   "Atrial fibrillation: Overview and management  of new-onset atrial fibrillation" .)  Prevention of recurrence   —   The decision to start antiarrhythmic drug therapy in patients  with PAF is similar to that in the general population of patients with AF. (See   "Management  of atrial fibrillation: Rhythm control versus rate control" .)  Patients with frequent or highly symptomatic PAF may require pharmacologic or  nonpharmacologic therapy to prevent recurrence. The choice between these therapies is  discussed separately (See   "Maintenance of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation: Catheter  ablation versus antiarrhythmic drug therapy" .):  Rate control   —   Daily use of a rate-controlling agent such as a beta blocker, calcium  channel blocker, or   digoxin   is generally not needed for PAF. However, for patients with  highly symptomatic episodes, such drugs can be used for acute episodes, and some  patients are maintained on one of these drugs to control the ventricular rate when PAF  occurs. (See   "Control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation who do not have  heart failure: Pharmacologic therapy" .)  with increased stroke risk (odds ratio [OR], 3.71 95% CI 2.06-6.70). This study also  showed that stroke risk was highest during days 1 to 5 following the start of AF (OR  5.00; 95% CI, 2.62-9.55). Furthermore, AF >23 hours per day on a given day was  associated with a high risk of stroke (OR 5.00, 95% CI 2.08-12.01).  The choice of drug therapy is determined by associated clinical conditions as well as  patient preference. (See   "Antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm in patients  with atrial fibrillation: Recommendations" .)  ●  Catheter ablation is the primary nonpharmacologic approach to prevent recurrent AF.  Surgical-based ablation techniques such as the Maze procedure are generally  reserved for PAF patients undergoing other cardiac surgical procedures.   . (See   "Atrial  fibrillation: Catheter ablation"   and   "Atrial fibrillation: Surgical ablation" .)  ● 04.07.2023 08.53 Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 10 af 16 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/p…arch _ result&selectedTitle=3~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=2  Anticoagulation   —   For patients with PAF, the approach for deciding whether to  anticoagulate to reduce the risk of thromboembolism is similar to that for patients with  persistent or permanent AF. The burden of AF (duration and frequency of episodes) is a  factor for decision-making only for selected patients in whom the balance of benefit versus  risk of anticoagulation is uncertain, recognizing that it may not be possible to accurately  estimate AF burden, as discussed separately. (See   "Atrial fibrillation in adults: Selection of  candidates for anticoagulation", section on 'Paroxysmal AF' .)  Sinus node dysfunction   —   Patients with frequent AF episodes and long, symptomatic  post-conversion pauses due to sinus dysfunction are commonly treated with a pacemaker  (along with rate or rhythm control) (see   "Sinus node dysfunction: Treatment", section on  'Permanent pacing' ). A possible alternative option for selected patients with PAF and  minimally symptomatic sinus node dysfunction with relatively short pauses (eg, 2 to 3  seconds) is catheter ablation to minimize AF episodes and associated post-conversion  pauses. However, since ablation is not a cure for AF, a pacemaker may still be required if  there are symptomatic pauses. (See   "Sinus node dysfunction: Treatment", section on  'Catheter ablation' .)  The management of sinus node dysfunction is discussed further separately. (See   "Sinus  node dysfunction: Treatment", section on 'Treatment' .)  Management of heart failure   —   Management of heart failure in patients with AF is  discussed separately. (See   "The management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart  failure" .)

(See   "Society guideline links: Atrial  fibrillation"   and   "Society guideline links: Arrhythmias in adults" .)  SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS  Definition   – Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF; also known as intermittent AF) is  defined as AF that terminates spontaneously or with intervention within seven days  of onset. (See   'Definition and prevalence'   above.)  ● 04.07.2023 08.53 Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 11 af 16 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/p…earch _ result&selectedTitle=3~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=2  Precipitants   – Factors that precipitate PAF are incompletely understood but are  thought to be premature atrial complexes (PACs) and alterations in autonomic  nervous system activity. (See   'Pathogenesis'   above.)  ●  Symptoms   – Like sustained AF, PAF may or may not be accompanied by symptoms,  and the spectrum of symptoms is broad. The most common complaints include  palpitations, often accompanied by dyspnea, a sensation of lightheadedness, fatigue,  weakness, or generalized malaise. PAF may precipitate angina and/or ischemic  electrocardiogram changes. PAF rarely causes syncope. (See   'Clinical presentation'  above.)  ●  Recurrence   – Most patients with PAF have one or more recurrences in the next year.  Over one-third of patients with PAF may progress to persistent AF in 10 years, but the  risk of progression increases with older age and presence of cardiovascular  conditions such as rheumatic mitral stenosis and hypertension. (See   'Natural history'  above.)  ●  Thromboembolic risk   – Studies suggest that the risk of thromboembolic events in  patients with PAF is lower than the risk in patients with persistent or permanent AF, is  associated with AF burden (ie, percentage of time in AF), and is highest in the days  soon after an episode of AF. However, the available data do not provide a clear  threshold of AF burden or duration for elevated thromboembolic risk. The data  suggest that AF episodes lasting longer than 17 to 24 hours impart significant risk,  but the risk associated with shorter AF episodes is uncertain. (See   'Risk of  embolization'   above.)  ●  Management   – The management of the arrhythmia in patients with PAF is similar to  that for the general population of patients with AF. Important considerations are the  duration of AF and the presence or absence of symptoms during episodes. (See  'Management'   above and   "Atrial fibrillation: Overview and management of new-onset  atrial fibrillation" .)  ●  Anticoagulation   – For patients with PAF, the approach for deciding whether to  anticoagulate to reduce the risk of thromboembolism is similar to that for patients  with persistent or permanent AF. (See   "Atrial fibrillation in adults: Selection of  candidates for anticoagulation", section on 'Paroxysmal AF' .)  ● 04.07.2023 08.53 Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - UpToDate  Side 12 af 16 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation/p…arch _ result&selectedTitle=3~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=2  ACKNOWLEDGMENT  The UpToDate editorial staff thank Alan Cheng, MD, and Philip J Podrid, MD, FACC, who  contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.
