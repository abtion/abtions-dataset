What is atrial fibrillation?  Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm problem (   figure 1 ). The condition  can put you at risk of stroke and other problems, as well as death. Atrial fibrillation is  sometimes called "A-fib."  The top 2 chambers of your heart are called the "atria." They pump blood into the larger  bottom chambers, which pump blood to your lungs and the rest of your body. In A-fib,  your heart beats abnormally and the top chambers stop pumping blood as strongly as  normal.  In some people, A-fib never goes away. In others, A-fib can come and go, even with  treatment. If you had A-fib in the past, but have a normal heart rhythm now, ask your  doctor what you can do to keep A-fib from coming back.  You might be able to lower your chances of having A-fib again if you:  ®  Control your blood pressure ●  Avoid or limit alcohol ●  Cut down on caffeine ●  Get treatment for an overactive thyroid gland ●  Get regular exercise ●  Lose weight (if you are overweight) ●  Reduce stress ● 04.07.2023 09.16 Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 2 af 8 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-the-basics/pr…arch _ result&selectedTitle=47~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=46  What are the symptoms of A-fib?  Some people with A-fib have no symptoms. When symptoms do happen, they can include:  Is there a test for A-fib?  Yes. If your doctor or nurse thinks that you might have A-fib, they will probably do a test  called an electrocardiogram ("ECG"). It records the electrical activity in your heart.  How is A-fib treated?  In some cases, A-fib goes away on its own, even without treatment. But many people do  need treatment.  Treatment can include 1 or more of the following:  What will my life be like?  Feeling as though your heart is racing, skipping beats, or beating out of sync ●  Mild chest "tightness" or pain ●  Feeling lightheaded, dizzy, or like you might pass out ●  Having trouble breathing, especially with exercise ●  Medicines to control the speed or rhythm of the heartbeat ●  Medicines to keep clots from forming ●  "Cardioversion" – This involves applying an electrical current to the heart to fix its  rhythm.  ●  "Ablation" – These treatments involve destroying the small part of the heart that is  sending abnormal electrical signals. This can be done using heat ("radiofrequency  ablation") or cold ("cryoablation").  ●  Pacemaker – This is a device that is implanted in the body and sends electrical  signals to the heart to control the heartbeat.  ● 04.07.2023 09.16 Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 3 af 8 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-the-basics/pr…arch _ result&selectedTitle=47~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=46  Most people with A-fib are able to live normal lives. Still, it is important to take the  medicines that your doctor prescribes every day. Taking your medicines as directed can  help reduce the chances that your A-fib will cause a stroke. It's also a good idea to learn  what the signs and symptoms of a stroke are (   figure 2 ).

In atrial fibrillation,  the electrical signals that control the heartbeat are abnormal. As a result, the  top 2 chambers of the heart (see arrows) stop pumping effectively, and blood  that should move out of these chambers gets left behind.

If a person shows any of these signs,   call for an ambulance right away   (in the  US and Canada,   call 9-1-1 ).
