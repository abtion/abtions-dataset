All Rights Reserved.  Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)  Written by the doctors and editors at UpToDate  Please read the   Disclaimer   at the end of this page.  What is an ECG?  An ECG (also called an "electrocardiogram") is a test that records a person's heart rate  (how fast it beats) and rhythm. It does this by measuring the electrical activity in the heart.  A normal heartbeat happens when an electrical signal starts in a spot near the top of the  heart. This signal follows a path to spread across the heart. As it spreads, the signal causes  the heart muscle to squeeze. Each time the heart squeezes ("beats"), it pumps blood  through the whole body.  What is a stress test?  A stress test measures how well the heart works when it is beating fast and working hard.  When the heart pumps fast, it needs more blood. A stress test helps doctors see if the  heart is getting enough blood during these times. A stress test is sometimes called an  "exercise test" or a "treadmill test."  A person can have an ECG without having a stress test. But if a person has a stress test,  they will always have an ECG with it.  Why might my doctor order an ECG or a stress test?  Your doctor might order an ECG to:  ®  See if you are having or had a heart attack ● 04.07.2023 09.21 Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 2 af 9 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics/p…ucation:%20Atrial%20fibrillation%20&topicRef=3431&source=see _ link  Doctors usually order stress tests to check for problems that can happen when the heart  works hard. Your doctor might order a stress test to:  How do I prepare for an ECG or a stress test?  To prepare for a stress test, you will probably need to avoid eating, drinking, or smoking  for 3 hours beforehand. If you are on any heart medicines, you might also need to change  or stop some of them before the test. Your doctor or nurse should tell you if you need to  change or stop any of your medicines.  For your stress test, you should wear comfortable clothes that you can exercise in. You  should also bring any inhalers you use to help your breathing.  What happens during an ECG and stress test?  For an ECG, a doctor, nurse, or technician will first stick patches (called "electrodes") onto  your chest, arms, and legs (   figure 1 ). Wires connect the patches to the ECG machine.  The machine will measure and record your heart's electrical activity and print out the  Look for other heart conditions or follow a known heart condition ●  Help figure out why you have chest pain, trouble breathing, dizziness, a fast heart  rate, or other symptoms  ●  Check how healthy your heart is before you have surgery ●  Check how well your heart medicines or other heart treatments are working ●  See if you have coronary heart disease, heart failure, or another heart condition –  Coronary heart disease is a condition that puts you at risk for a heart attack and  other types of heart disease. Some people have symptoms of coronary heart disease  only when they exercise. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart doesn't pump  well.  ●  Check how well your heart works after heart surgery ●  Help figure out why you have chest pain, trouble breathing, or other symptoms ●  See if you can safely exercise after a heart attack ● 04.07.2023 09.21 Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 3 af 9 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics/p…ucation:%20Atrial%20fibrillation%20&topicRef=3431&source=see _ link  results. Having an ECG doesn't hurt.  For a stress test, the doctor, nurse, or technician will first do an ECG and measure your  blood pressure. Then they will "stress" your heart and increase your heart rate by doing  one of the following things:  Sometimes, doctors do imaging tests during a stress test. These kinds of tests create  images of the blood flow to the heart.  During your stress test, the doctor or nurse will watch you. They will check your blood  pressure, do several ECGs, and ask how you feel. You might also need to breathe into a  tube at certain times during the test. The test will end when you can't exercise anymore or  when your doctor or nurse tells you the test is over.  What are the downsides of an ECG and stress test?  An ECG has very few downsides. Some people get a mild rash where the patches were  placed.  A stress test can have some downsides. When people exercise and their heart pumps fast,  they can have symptoms such as:  Have you run or walk on a treadmill (   figure 2 ) ●  Have you pedal a stationary bike (a bike that doesn't move, except for the pedals) ●  Have you use an "arm ergometer" – This is a machine that is similar to a bike you  pedal with your hands instead of your feet. It is sometimes called a "hand crank" or  "hand bike."  ●  Give you medicine to make your heart beat faster – People who can't run or walk can  get medicine instead of exercising. In this case, they might also have you squeeze a  small ball, or lift up or move your legs to make your heart beat faster if the medicine  doesn't get your heart rate up enough.  ●  An abnormal heartbeat ●  Trouble breathing ●  Feeling dizzy or faint ● 04.07.2023 09.21 Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 4 af 9 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics/…ucation:%20Atrial%20fibrillation%20&topicRef=3431&source=see _ link  The medicines used during a stress test can also cause side effects, including headaches,  dizziness, or nausea.

During a stress test, you  either exercise (such as on a treadmill, shown here) or take medicine to  make your heart pump faster. A test called an ECG (also called an  electrocardiogram or EKG) is done during the stress test. For an ECG,  patches (called "electrodes")   are stuck to   your chest. Wires run from the  patches to the ECG machine to measure the electrical activity in your heart.  Your blood pressure   is also   checked   during a stress test.
