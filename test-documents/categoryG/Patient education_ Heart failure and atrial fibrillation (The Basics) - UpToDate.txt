What is heart failure?  Heart failure is a condition in which the heart does not pump as well as it should. This  causes the heart to lag behind in its job of moving blood through the body. As a result,  fluid backs up in the body, and the organs do not get as much blood flow as they need.  This can lead to symptoms such as swelling, trouble breathing, and feeling tired.  What is atrial fibrillation?  Atrial fibrillation is a problem with the heart's rhythm. In atrial fibrillation, the electrical  signals that control the heartbeat become abnormal, and the top 2 heart chambers beat  abnormally. When this happens, blood can pool in these chambers and form clots. These  clots can travel up to the brain through the blood vessels and cause strokes. (A stroke is  when a part of the brain is damaged because of a problem with blood flow.)  Besides raising your risk of stroke, atrial fibrillation can make you feel like your heart is  racing, skipping beats, or beating out of sync. It can also make you feel dizzy or out of  breath.  Can people have both heart failure and atrial fibrillation?  Yes, many people have both heart failure and atrial fibrillation. People usually have only 1  ® 04.07.2023 09.19 Patient education: Heart failure and atrial fibrillation (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 2 af 10 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-and-atrial-fibrilla…earch _ result&selectedTitle=3~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=3  of these conditions at first. But then, their condition "stresses" the heart and affects the  way that it works, causing the other condition to happen.  What should I know if I have both heart failure and atrial fibrillation?  If you have both conditions, and 1 gets worse, the other condition is likely to get worse,  too.  If that happens, your doctor will try to figure out which condition is the bigger problem so  that they can treat that problem first. But if both conditions are causing problems, you  might need treatment for both at once.  The treatment will depend on:  To figure out the cause of your heart failure or atrial fibrillation, your doctor will talk with  you and do an exam. They might also do tests.  How are heart failure and atrial fibrillation treated?  The treatments for heart failure and atrial fibrillation are different. But your doctor can  treat both conditions at the same time.  Doctors treat heart failure with different types of medicines (see   "Patient education:  Medicines for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (The Basics)" ). Most people need  to take more than 1 medicine every day. These medicines can improve your symptoms  and help you feel better. Some medicines might help you live longer.  Treatment for atrial fibrillation can include 1 or more of the following:  Your symptoms ●  The cause of your heart failure or atrial fibrillation ●  Medicines – Doctors can use different types of medicines to treat atrial fibrillation. ●  A treatment called "cardioversion," which involves applying an electrical current to  the heart to fix its rhythm  ●  A treatment called "ablation," which uses heat or cold to create a scar to block the ● 04.07.2023 09.19 Patient education: Heart failure and atrial fibrillation (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 3 af 10 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-and-atrial-fibrilla…earch _ result&selectedTitle=3~150&usage _ type=default&display _ rank=3  When should I call the doctor or nurse?  Call your doctor or nurse if you have new or worse symptoms of heart failure or atrial  fibrillation.  Symptoms of heart failure can include:  This action plan (   figure 1   and   figure 2 ) lists the symptoms that you should watch for  every day.  Symptoms of atrial fibrillation can include:  You should also learn the signs and symptoms of a stroke (   figure 3 ). If you have any of  these signs or symptoms,   call for an ambulance   (in the US and Canada,   call 9-1-1 ) or get  to the hospital quickly.
