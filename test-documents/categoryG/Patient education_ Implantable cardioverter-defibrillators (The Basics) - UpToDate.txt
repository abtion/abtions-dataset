Patient education: Implantable cardioverter-  defibrillators (The Basics)  Written by the doctors and editors at UpToDate  Please read the   Disclaimer   at the end of this page.  What is an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator?  An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, also called an "ICD," is a device that goes under a  person's skin near their heart (   figure 1 ). An ICD can sense and treat certain abnormal  heartbeats.  A person's heart needs to beat normally in order to pump blood to the brain and rest of  the body. But sometimes, a person's heartbeat can suddenly become abnormal. The  heartbeat could be too slow, too fast, or out of rhythm.  Some abnormal heartbeats are dangerous, because they can prevent the heart from  pumping blood to the brain and rest of the body. A "cardiac arrest" is when an abnormal  heartbeat prevents the heart from pumping blood normally. A cardiac arrest can happen  without warning, and can cause death if it is not treated right away.  An ICD can treat the abnormal heartbeats that can lead to a cardiac arrest. People who  have an ICD have a greater chance of surviving a cardiac arrest.  Why might I need an ICD?  You might need an ICD if you:  ®  Have a condition that can cause abnormal heartbeats ● 04.07.2023 09.20 Patient education: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 2 af 8 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibri…ducation:%20Atrial%20fibrillation%20&topicRef=3431&source=see _ link  How does an ICD work?  An ICD works to:  What does an ICD look like?  An ICD has 2 parts:  Can there be side effects to having an ICD?  Yes. Your doctor will talk with you about the different side effects that can occur. Side  effects can occur when a doctor puts in an ICD. People who have had an ICD for a long  time can also have side effects. But most people do not have any side effects from having  an ICD.  Have had 1 or more episodes of abnormal heartbeats ●  Sense abnormal heartbeats ●  Give the heart 1 or more treatments if the heartbeat becomes abnormal. This can  involve sending quick electrical pulses to make the heart beat at a certain speed. It  can also involve giving a shock of electricity. These treatments can get the heart to  beat normally again on its own.  ●  Record abnormal heartbeats so that a doctor can see how a person's heart has been  beating  ●  Battery (   picture 1 ) – This sits under the skin. Depending on the type of ICD, it goes  either in the upper chest or on the side, near the armpit. When the ICD senses an  abnormal heartbeat, the battery creates an electrical shock or shocks that travel  through wires to the heart.  ●  Wires, also called "leads" – In many ICDs, these go from the battery through a vein  (blood vessel) and into the heart. There is another type of ICD that has wires that go  under the skin. These wires sit near the heart but not actually inside the heart.  ● 04.07.2023 09.20 Patient education: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 3 af 8 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibri…ducation:%20Atrial%20fibrillation%20&topicRef=3431&source=see _ link  What should I do after my ICD treats an abnormal heartbeat?  If your ICD gives you a shock, you will probably feel it, although it is possible you might  pass out before you notice any pain. If either of these things happen, let your doctor  know. They will look at the record of your heartbeats and might decide to make changes  to the way your ICD works.  Do people with an ICD need other treatment?  Sometimes people with an ICD will need other treatment. This can include medicines or  procedures.  What if I want to get pregnant?  If you want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor or nurse. Many people with an ICD are  able to have a baby.  What will my life be like?  Most people with an ICD have a normal life. But you will need to:  Check your ICD on a regular basis to make sure that it works – Many people can  check their ICD from their home, using either their phone or computer.  ●  Talk to your doctor about driving – Many states do not allow people to drive for some  amount of time after they have an ICD put in or after they get a shock from their ICD.  Your doctor will tell you how long you need to wait before you drive again.  ●  Avoid certain electric or magnetic sources – People who have an ICD need to avoid  certain electric or magnetic sources or equipment. Your doctor will tell you which  ones are safe for you to be near, and which ones you should avoid. For example,  some people with an ICD should not walk through a metal detector at the airport.  People who cannot walk through a metal detector can have a security search by  hand instead.  ● 04.07.2023 09.20 Patient education: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 4 af 8 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibri…ducation:%20Atrial%20fibrillation%20&topicRef=3431&source=see _ link  Some people who have an ICD feel worried or sad. If you feel worried or sad, let your  doctor or nurse know so they can help.

If you are  not sure if your device has a magnet, check with the company that made it, or ask  your doctor. To be safe, it's a good idea to carry your cell phone in a pocket or bag  below your waist so it is not right next to your ICD.  ●  Let all of your doctors and nurses know that you have an ICD – Some procedures and  tests are safe for people with an ICD, but others are not. For example, most people  with an ICD should not have a type of imaging test called an MRI scan, but some new  ICDs are safe in the MRI machine. Most doctors recommend that people wear a  medical bracelet letting others know that they have an ICD.  ● 04.07.2023 09.20 Patient education: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 5 af 8 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/implantable-cardioverter-defibri…ducation:%20Atrial%20fibrillation%20&topicRef=3431&source=see _ link  endorse any treatments or medications as safe, effective, or approved for treating a  specific patient.
