"Tachycardia" is the medical term for a heartbeat that is faster than normal. Sometimes, a  fast heartbeat is a normal response to exercising or feeling excited or anxious. But other  times, a fast heartbeat is a sign of another problem.  What causes tachycardia?  Exercising or feeling excited, anxious, or afraid can all cause tachycardia.  Other things that can cause tachycardia include:  Problems with your heart's electrical system can also cause tachycardia. Some people are  born with these problems. Other people get them because of high blood pressure, a heart  attack, or other heart problems.  What are the symptoms of tachycardia?  ®  Having too many drinks with caffeine, such as coffee, tea, or soda ●  Smoking or using chewing tobacco ●  Taking certain illegal drugs, such as cocaine ●  Having a fever ●  Having a thyroid condition ● 04.07.2023 09.22 Patient education: Tachycardia (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 2 af 7 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tachycardia-the-basics/print ? sea…ucation:%20Atrial%20fibrillation%20&topicRef=3431&source=see _ link  Most people with tachycardia have no symptoms. But they might notice that their heart is  beating fast, beating hard, or skipping a beat. These kinds of heartbeat changes are called  "palpitations."  Sometimes, a fast heartbeat makes it harder for your heart to pump blood to your body.  This can cause symptoms such as:  Is there a test for tachycardia?  Yes. Your doctor or nurse will probably do a test called an electrocardiogram ("ECG"). This  test measures the electrical activity in your heart (   figure 1 ).  You might also need other tests to see if another condition is causing your fast heartbeat.  Should I see a doctor or nurse?  If you have trouble breathing or have chest pain that lasts for more than a few minutes,  call for an ambulance   (in the US and Canada,   call 9-1-1 ).  If you do not have these problems, but you often feel your heart beating fast or  irregularly, tell your doctor or nurse.  How is tachycardia treated?  The treatment depends on the cause of the tachycardia. When your heartbeat is very fast,  your doctor might suggest ways to slow it down. They might have you cough, or bear  down as if you're having a bowel movement. They might also put an ice pack on your face.  Doing these things can affect the nerve that helps control your heartbeat.  Other treatments can include:  Dizziness ●  Trouble breathing ●  Chest pain ●  Fainting ● 04.07.2023 09.22 Patient education: Tachycardia (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 3 af 7 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tachycardia-the-basics/print ? sea…ucation:%20Atrial%20fibrillation%20&topicRef=3431&source=see _ link  Can tachycardia be prevented?  If drinking too much caffeine or smoking caused your tachycardia, stopping those habits  can prevent the problem.  Heart disease can increase your chance of having tachycardia.

The ICD can help make your heartbeat normal using  mild electrical currents.  ●  "Ablation" treatments, which use heat (called "radiofrequency ablation") or cold  (called "cryoablation") to destroy the small part of the heart that is sending the  abnormal electrical signals.  ●  Surgery to create scar tissue in the heart. This will block the flow of the electrical  signals that make your heartbeat abnormal.  ●  Eating lots of fruits and vegetables and low-fat dairy products, but not a lot of meat  or fatty foods  ●  Walking or doing physical activity on most days of the week ●  Losing weight, if you are overweight ● 04.07.2023 09.22 Patient education: Tachycardia (The Basics) - UpToDate  Side 4 af 7 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tachycardia-the-basics/print ? sea…ucation:%20Atrial%20fibrillation%20&topicRef=3431&source=see _ link  All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our   peer review process   is complete.

There are patches, called "electrodes," stuck onto the chest, arms, and  legs. Wires run from the electrodes to the ECG machine. An ECG measures the  electrical activity in the heart.
